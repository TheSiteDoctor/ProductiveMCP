## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Page create/update body was silently ignored — Productive's Pages API expects body as a stringified JSON document, not a raw JSON object
- Exported `ProductiveDoc` and `ProductiveDocNode` types from `src/types.ts` for reuse
- Added `markdownToProductiveDocString()` wrapper for the API's expected string format

### Documentation
