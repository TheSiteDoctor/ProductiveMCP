# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- `query` parameter on `productive_list_people` — search people by name or email via `filter[query]`
- `assignee_id` parameter on `productive_update_task` — assign or unassign tasks (pass `null` to clear)
- Dynamic server version — MCP server now reports actual version from package.json instead of hardcoded `1.0.0`

### Fixed

- **Page body persistence**: Pages API expects body as a stringified JSON string, not a raw JSON object. Body content now correctly persists on create and update.
- **Label duplicate prevention**: Label resolution now fetches existing options from the Productive API with case-insensitive matching instead of relying on a stale local config. Results cached for 5 minutes with pagination support.
- **Estimate updates**: `estimate_minutes` on update now sets `remaining_time` (the displayed "Time to complete" in Productive) instead of `initial_estimate`, which is only meaningful at creation time.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- `productive_create_milestone` tool — creates milestones (tasks with `type_id: 3`) in Productive.io, with support for title, description, due date, assignee, and workflow status
- `milestone_only` filter on `productive_search_tasks` — filters results to milestones only (`type_id=3`)
- `is_milestone` flag surfaced in all task responses; milestone creation output shows "Milestone Created Successfully"

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Labels support**: Labels are now handled as multi-select custom fields (auto-discovered by setup script)
- Labels on create_task, update_task, and batch create — new labels auto-created as custom field options
- Labels displayed in task output (markdown and JSON formats)
- **Search enhancements**: `created_after`, `created_before`, `updated_after`, `sort`, and `task_list_id` filters on search_tasks

### Fixed

- **Custom fields merge on update**: `updateTask` now GETs existing custom_fields before PATCHing, preventing task_type/priority/labels from being wiped when updating other custom fields

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- Page create/update body was silently ignored — Productive's Pages API expects body as a stringified JSON document, not a raw JSON object
- Exported `ProductiveDoc` and `ProductiveDocNode` types from `src/types.ts` for reuse
- Added `markdownToProductiveDocString()` wrapper for the API's expected string format

### Documentation

- Added "Body Format Gotchas" section to CLAUDE.md documenting the different formats across endpoints
